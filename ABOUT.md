## This Project in a Nutshell:

It's a simple site hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) that parses a JSON input and presents results based on search parameters entered by the user.

### Language and Technologies Used:

Java was used for the backend implementation as it's the language I'm most familiar with.
JavaServer Faces (JSF) technology was used for implementing the UI. I had neither a previous knowledge nor experience in it but I always wanted to learn it and this project pushed me to do so.
The project also gave me the opportunity to learn about Heroku and GIT as I had no previous knowledge in any of them.

### General Thoughts on the Project (what I would've done):

#### - Write unit tests.
#### - Although it's mentioned that the UI design is not important, but I wanted to add some CSS classes for a better layout.
#### - Add more search fields and return more details.
#### - Build an expression builder so the user will have the ability to use 'AND' and 'OR' in the search.
#### - Return a friendly message in case no results were found instead of returning an empty table.
